All C++ variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.





The general rules for naming variables are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
- Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (\_).
- Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables).
- Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
- Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names.




``` cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main() {
  int my_age = 182991;
  string my_locatoon = "Asia , Bangladesh  !!";
  cout << my_age << "\n";
  cout << my_locatoon << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
