5. Write a C++ program to calculate the area of Triangle/ Circle/ Square.

> ```cpp
> #include <iostream>
> using namespace std;
>
> int main() {
>    // for triangle
>    float base, height, result_triangle;
>    cout << "Enter base and height for triangle: ";
>    cin >> base >> height;
>    result_triangle = 0.5 * base * height;
>
>    // for circle
>    float radius, result_circle;
>    cout << "Enter radius for circle: ";
>    cin >> radius;
>    result_circle = 3.14159 * radius * radius;
>
>    // for square
>    float side, result_square;
>    cout << "Enter side for square: ";
>    cin >> side;
>    result_square = side * side;
>
>    cout << "Triangle Area: " << result_triangle << endl;
>    cout << "Circle Area: " << result_circle << endl;
>    cout << "Square Area: " << result_square << endl;
>    return 0;
> }
> ```

6. Write a C++ program to calculate Celsius temperature from Fahrenheit temperature.

> ```cpp
> #include <iostream>
> using namespace std;
>
> int main() {
>    // fahrenheit to celsius
>    // formula => (f-32)*(5/9)
>
>    double fahrenheit;
>    cin >> fahrenheit;
>    double celsius = (fahrenheit - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0);
>
>    cout << "Fahrenheit: " << fahrenheit << endl;
>    cout << "Celsius: " << celsius << endl;
>
>    return 0;
> }
> ```

7. Write a C++ program to calculate Fahrenheit temperature from Celsius temperature.

> ```cpp
> #include <iostream>
> using namespace std;
>
> int main() {
>    // celsius to fahrenheit
>    // formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32
>
>    double celsius;
>    cin >> celsius;
>    double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
>
>    cout << "Celsius: " << celsius << endl;
>    cout << "Fahrenheit: " << fahrenheit << endl;
>
>    return 0;
